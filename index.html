    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold"</p>
    <p>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</p>
    <p>The player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</p>
    <p>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</p>
    <p>First player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
